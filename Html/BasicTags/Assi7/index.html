        Subhas Chandra Bose, popularly known as <b>Netaji</b>, was born on 23rd January 1897 in Cuttack, Odisha. His father, Janakinath Bose, was a lawyer, and his mother, Prabhavati Devi, was a devoted homemaker. From childhood, Bose showed discipline, courage, and a deep love for his country.

        He studied in Calcutta and later went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services. Though he cleared the exam, he resigned from the job, as he wanted to dedicate his life to India’s freedom. This decision reflected his fearless and patriotic spirit.

        Bose rose as a leader in the Indian National Congress and was elected its President twice. However, he differed from Gandhi’s non-violence approach and believed in more forceful action to drive out the British. His revolutionary ideas made him very popular among the youth.

        During World War II, he formed the Indian National Army (INA), also called the Azad Hind Fauj. With the slogan “Give me blood, and I will give you freedom”, he inspired thousands of Indians to join him in the fight against the British.
